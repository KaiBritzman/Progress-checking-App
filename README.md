Project description: My project is a to-do-list website where people can create tasks that they need to complete on a given day. This website gamifys the process by giving xp for every task completed. When it comes to stuff like starting a business, getting healither, people struggle with motivation to do tasks to reach to their goals. This website helps by making it a game to get to a higher level. People will be more motivated because they get to see progress everyday. Without it, people may not see progress for ages, so they lose motivation.

Task list:
Create main page: Make title, headings, level and xp section, overall layout
Create user interaction: Make task creation input and button
Javascript: Make the Javascript for level system, creating tasks
